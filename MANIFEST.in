# MANIFEST.in lists all extra files for sdist to include in a distribution.

# By default, because we specify no MANIFEST file, sdist will include
# README.txt, all *.py files it finds, etc... For a full list, see:
# http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute

# Include all files in these directories
